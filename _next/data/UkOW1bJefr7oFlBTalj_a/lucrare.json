{"pageProps":{"id":["lucrare"],"pageTitle":"lucrare","pageData":{"contentHtml":"In this project we will deal with cs.pub.ro, the website of the Computer Science and Engineering Department. The objective is to implement a solution for updating the website content using Markdown. This approach has the advantage of eliminating the need to make changes in the source code of the application when updating the content or the structure or the website. Thus, helping to keep the information available on the site up to date.\nAfter conducting an analysis of the application, we concluded that it fulfills the objectives initially set, making maintenance easier, offering a simpler way to keep the content up to date, but also providing advantages when it comes to security and simplifying the necessary infrastructure. At the same time, offering performance comparable to other available solutions.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
