The two teams have also participated in a mobility project where students from both universities benefited from courses taught by exchange professors. However, there are a lot of possibilities for a collaborative research that have not been explored yet. The proposed intensive programmes will further strengthen the cooperation between the two partners and will lead to the successful conception of new research projects. During these programmes, the participants will discuss and experiment ideas that will build towards a new research project proposal. Specifically, the envisaged goal of the new research is the development of a social portal of interactive audio content for visually impaired people and their sighted friends. The main purpose of the portal is to be a tool for promoting highly interactive audio content and to support and inform the blind community. Through this portal, the visually impaired people will have the opportunity to have access to entertainment content, train and socialize. nThese intensive programmes will help the participants to create a unified view of the new project goals, structure and management and to clarify aspects related to writing of the proposal.n<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, SEE<!-- -->, July 2016 - January 2017</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Anca Morar(Coordinator); Alin Moldoveanu(Member); Florina Oana BĂLAN(Member); Florica Moldoveanu(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><a href="http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA15140" target="_blank">ImAppNIO - Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice</a></p><p> <!-- -->Nature-inspired search and optimisation heuristics are easy to implement and apply to new problems. However, in order to achieve good performance it is usually necessary to adjust them to the problem at hand. Theoretical foundations for the understanding of such approaches have been built very successfully in the past 20 years but there is a huge disconnect between the theoretical basis and practical applications. The development of powerful analytical tools, significant insights in general limitations of different types of nature-inspired optimisation methods and the development of more practically relevant perspectives for theoretical analysis have brought impressive advances to the theory-side of the field. However, so far impact on the application-side has been limited and few people in the diverse potential application areas have benefitted from these advances. The main objective of the COST Action is to bridge this gap and improve the applicability of all kinds of nature-inspired optimisation methods. It aims at making theoretical insights more accessible and practical by creating a platform where theoreticians and practitioners can meet and exchange insights, ideas and needs; by developing robust guidelines and practical support for application development based on theoretical insights; by developing theoretical frameworks driven by actual needs arising from practical applications; by training Early Career Investigators in a theory of nature-inspired optimisation methods that clearly aims at practical applications; by broadening participation in the ongoing research of how to develop and apply robust nature-inspired optimisation methods in different application areas.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, COST Action<!-- -->, ID.

When this high blood pressure is combined with a high protein level in urine, the mother is affected by preeclampsia. This asymptomatic pathology usually starts in the second semester and affects 10% of pregnant women. To diagnose preeclampsia, doctors usually monitor the BP by two measurements of blood pressure during the second and the third semester. However, the BP measurements are not always likely to happen while the mother is experiencing a hypertensive episode. Thus, the pathology cannot be detected on time, and the mother is exposed to a higher risk of eclampsia. Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizure in pregnant women following by a period of confusion and/or coma. Eclampsia is a vital emergency for both the fetuses and the mother. It represents the second causes of maternal death during pregnancy.nHere, the gap in diagnostics is caused by the discontinuity of the blood pressure measurement, which brings the necessity to develop new technologies to ensure continuous monitoring of blood pressure.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, EUROSTARS<!-- -->, March 2016 - March 2019</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Anca Morar(Coordinator)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><span class="pubAndProj_title__auq2r">CONDEGRID - Contributia nationala la dezvoltarea gridului de calcul LCG pentru fizica particulelor elementare</span></p><p> <!-- --> </p><p>National project<!-- -->, March 2016 - December 2019</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Nicolae Tapus(Coordinator); Mihai Carabas(Member); Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><span class="pubAndProj_title__auq2r">Premiere H2020 - Data4Water</span></p><p> <!-- --> </p><p>National project<!-- -->, UEFISCDI<!-- -->, 2016 - 2018</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Mariana Mocanu(Coordinator); Alexandru Predescu(Member); Catalin Negru(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><span class="pubAndProj_title__auq2r">Text2NeuralQL - Interogarea bazelor de date în limbaj natural folosind învățare profundă</span></p><p> <!-- -->Proiectul Text2NeuralQL are ca obiectiv principal construirea unei soluții pentru generarea automată a interogărilor pentru baze de date structurate (SQL) pornind de la texte în limbaj natural.

The complexity of research related to water resources management is extremely high and requires deep expertise in several ICT-related research domains such as: Big Data and Smart Data; semantic Internet of Things; context-aware and event-based systems; Cloud computing; Web services;, and social Web. The dynamics of water and the role of humans in the water cycle are not well understood largely because environmental and socio-economic analyses have traditionally been performed separately; and the methods, tools, and data needed for multidisciplinary work are not yet at the required level to satisfactory address problems posed in managing resources in aquatic environments. ICT can contribute to several areas of research such as better understanding of coupled human-natural system dynamics; finding risk mitigation measures for the unintended consequences and side effects like water scarcity, increased pollution, unreasonable use of water, flood, food prices; and can contribute to the development of strategies for efficient use of water resources.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, H2020 <!-- -->, ID. 690900<!-- -->, January 2016 - December 2018</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Mariana Mocanu(Coordinator); Valentin Cristea(Member); Nicolae Tapus(Member); Marian Muste(Member); Florin Pop(Member); Catalin Leordeanu(Member); Elena Apostol(Member); Mihai CARABAŞ(Member); Dumitru-Cristian TRANCĂ(Member); Ciprian Dobre(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div></div></div><div><p class="pubAndProj_title__auq2r">2015</p> <div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><a href="https://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/project/id/9831" target="_blank">HAI-OPS - Hospital Acquired Infection and Outbreak Prevention System</a></p><p> <!-- -->HAI-OPS focuses on the prevention of outbreaks of hospital acquired infections (HAI).The proposed solution is a cyber-physical system integrating a network of sensors that will monitor clinical workflows and ambient conditions together with a configurable, standards-compliant software platform integrated with local Hospital Information Systems (HIS), that will provide both real-time information &amp; alerts, and advanced analytics for HAI and outbreak prevention.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, Eurostars, applied research<!-- -->, ID.

The Action will fill this gap by offering the respective solutions to provide resilient communications in the presence of disaster-based disruptions of all types for existing communication networks (e.g., IPv4-based, current Internet), as well as emerging architectures of the global communications infrastructure (i.e., the Future Internet). Geographical diversity characteristics of disaster-based disruptions across Europe requires creation of an international and geographically diverse group of researchers to provide the proper solutions. Therefore, COST Action is viewed as the best way to address this issue. This output-oriented Action will be driven by researchers from academia and industry in strong cooperation with governmental bodies. The aim is to introduce the set of techniques of resilient communications, as well as recommendations on how to deploy/update topologies of communication networks to make them resistant to disruptions that can be applied in practice by network equipment operators and national/international network providers at the European level.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, COST Action<!-- -->, ID.

Its aim is to respond to an ever-increasing demand by making it possible for everyone to use Twitter’s API to easily collect tweets with specific restrictions, even to those without any programming skills. CATS is meant to be a starting point in the development of new means of data collection on Twitter, in order to make it easier for everyone to use it. This will hopefully give researchers (and others) new possibilities and tools to put to good use in their respective areas of research. CATS is not meant to be a fixed interface. It will be a constant work in progress, adding new functionalities with time according to people’s needs. Thus, it will be everyone’s role to participate in its construction, by providing feedback, or by helping with certain tasks when possible (annotation of tweets for certain machine-learning tasks, creation of lists the program would use to focus on certain parameters (specific words, jobs, cities etc…), manual verification of automated processes in order to improve the program etc…).

Today, these no longer consist only of connected servers, but involve a wide range of pervasive and embedded devices, leading to the concept of ubiquitous computing systems. The objective of the Action is to improve and adapt the existent cryptanalysis methodologies and tools to the ubiquitous computing framework. Cryptanalysis, which is the assessment of theoretical and practical cryptographic mechanisms designed to ensure security and privacy, will be implemented along four axes: cryptographic models, cryptanalysis of building blocks, hardware and software security engineering, and security assessment of real-world systems. Researchers have only recently started to focus on the security of ubiquitous computing systems. Despite the critical flaws found, the required highly-specialized skills and the isolation of the involved disciplines are a true barrier for identifying additional issues. The Action will establish a network of complementary skills, so that expertise in cryptography, information security, privacy, and embedded systems can be put to work together. The outcome will directly help industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies to increase security and privacy in ubiquitous computing systems, in order to eventually make citizens better protected in their everyday life.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, COST Action<!-- -->, ID.

Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from a number of limitations when applied to multi-source scenarios requiring some form of query planning, and with frequent updates precluding any effective implementation of data indexes. Typical scenarios include open data, big data and virtual data integration systems. Therefore, building effective keyword searching techniques can have an extensive impact since it allows non-professional users to access large amounts of information stored in structured repositories through simple keyword-based query interfaces. This revolutionises the paradigm of searching for data since users are offered access to structured data in a similar manner to the one they already use for documents. To build a successful, unified and effective solution - due to the multifaceted nature of the problem - the Action proposes to join synergies from several disciplines, such as semantic data management, the semantic web, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, machine learning, user interaction, service science, service design, and natural language processing.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, COST<!-- -->, November 2013 - November 2017</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Florin Pop(Coordinator); Ciprian Dobre(Member); Andrei-Horia Mogos(Member); Valentin Cristea(Member); Nicolae Tapus(Member); Mariana Mocanu(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><span class="pubAndProj_title__auq2r">CS4HS - Google CS4HS R&amp;D Grant - Development and assessment of Python and Robotics Technical Skills</span></p><p> <!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, R&amp;D Grant<!-- -->, April 2013 - February 2014</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Razvan Rughinis(Coordinator); Daniel Rosner(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><a href="http://www.trilogy2.it.uc3m.es/" target="_blank">TRILOGY2 - TRILOGY2</a></p><p> <!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, FP7<!-- -->, January 2013 - January 2016</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Costin Raiciu(Coordinator); Dragoș Ștefan Niculescu(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><a href="http://sidestep.hpc.pub.ro" target="_blank">SideSTEP - Metode de Planificare pentru Sisteme Distribuite Dinamice: o Abordare Adaptiva (Scheduling Methods for Dynamic Distributed Systems: a self-* approach)</a></p><p> <!-- -->The goal of SiDeSTEP project is to propose new methods for resource management and tasks assignment in dynamic distributed systems with the capability of self-organizing, self-healing and self-stabilizing. The specific objectives consider models and algorithms for self-* ubiquitous Cloud. For validation purposes, experimental prototypes will be implemented and tested on several scenarios and evaluated using simulation.nThe SiDeSTEP joint team will involve several visits and internships in both directions by Master and PhD students, post-doc researchers and full researchers. They will disseminate research results by publishing of papers in major international peer-reviewed journals, as chapters in edited-books or in well-established international conferences and workshops. Technical workshops will be organized as a perfect way to evaluate and exploit the experimental and theoretical results obtained in SiDeSTEP project.nThe UPB-NCIT team’s research is directed on large-scale distributed systems middleware. The focus is on system monitoring and control, resource management, meta-scheduling, workflow-based scheduling, evaluation using modeling and simulation. The team is involved in several international and national collaborative projects on distributed computing. The team’s high expertise acquired in the specific area of resource management for the Clouds represents a significant factor for the proposed associated team.nThe LIP6 team focuses on the theoretical aspects of fault-tolerant distributed systems with specific emphasize on dynamic, large scale and mobile systems. So far, the team  focused on several dynamic systems such as P2P, mobile and fixed sensor networks. The ubiquitous cloud is the next step in the study of dynamic distributed systems since these networks also bring the difficulty of heterogenous dynamic interaction – area completely new in distributed computing.  The romanian team offers us the possibility to validate models and algorithms on a academic cloud and execute on top of this cloud dynamic applications with mobile clients.

The versatile use of new mobile phones, and the development of home wireless networks, as well as the emergence of pervasive wireless systems, are strengthening this tendency.nTo date, no adverse health effects have been established, although questions still exist. In order to respond to the public concern, some national or local authorities have recommended some practices and measures to minimise EMF exposure, but these actions focus mainly on cellular network base stations and access points. Since the exposure is induced by the downlink (from the network to the phone), but also from the uplinks (from the phone to the network), these actions do not correctly respond to the relevant questions and even can induce a rise of exposure.n17 leading telecommunications operators, vendors, research centers and academic institutions have launched the LEXNET project (Low EMF Exposure Networks), a research project supported by the European Commission under the FP7 workprogram, to develop effective mechanisms to reduce 50% (at least) of the public exposure to EMF, without compromising the quality of service.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, FP7<!-- -->, ID. 2342342<!-- -->, November 2012 - September 2015</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Coordinator); Nicolae Tapus(Member); Dan Tudose(Member); Andrei Voinescu(Member); Laura RUSE(Member); Voichita Iancu(Member); Silvia Cristina Stegaru(Member); Dan Dragomir(Member); Adriana Draghici(Member); George Pantelimon Popescu(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><a href="http://sidedown.hpc.pub.ro" target="_blank">SideDOWN - Smart Internet Data Downloader and Aggregator</a></p><p> <!-- -->Obiectivul principal al proiectului a fost realizarea unei legaturi catre sursele de date nestructurate, de tip web, in vederea identificarii entitatilor implicate si extragerea informatiilor despre acestea.

Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. With regard to the accessibility of stakeholders to information, there are situations when information is to be accessed only by designated stakeholders, but there is a huge amount of information that is, and should be handled, as public information. The overarching goal of the proposal is to create an e-platform using advanced computational and communication technology for managing water and land resources in a sustainable and integrative manner, focused on pollution phenomena. The progress of information and communication technologies makes possible the access to relevant information and to provide feedback on the observed processes by means of e-services and ancillary data repositories. The multi-agent approach encompasses agent types with various behavior and specific interaction to the environment that are implemented as web-services. The specific objective is to implement a pilot platform for monitoring water pollution related phenomena and support to decision making in critical situation. Solving such water problems requires an interdisciplinary approach (hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and ecosystem). The composite application framework will integrate existing software and new e-services compliant to Directive 2007/2/EC regarding metadata for spatial data sets, data series and data services for environmental resources, protection and conservation.<!-- --> </p><p>National project<!-- -->, PNII - Parteneriate PCCA 1<!-- -->, ID.

Therefore, an increasing number of applications are developed in several business domains, ranging from defense, public security, energy management and traffic control to health care. Sensor networks are particularly interesting due to their ability to control and monitor physical environments. Nevertheless, several technical (e.g. remote management, deployment) and security (e.g. user’s privacy, data confidentiality and reliability) challenges deter that integration. The TWISNet project aims at supporting and securing the integration of sensor networks into large scale industrial environments. In the scope of TWISNet, a number of use cases, from nuclear plant facility to supply and demand energy management, which illustrate the integration of sensor networks into industrial environments are considered. From those use cases, user’s privacy, node authentication and data reliability appear as the most important security requirements. The TWISNet project is going to provide a platform enabling business application to command and control sensor network in a secure and trusted way. Integrating commercial off-the-shelf or pre-standard devices, that platform serves as a mediation layer between the sensor network and industrial applications. Empowered with security architecture addressing the major business application security requirements (e.g. user’s privacy, data confidentiality, reliability), that platform is validated based on the identified use cases. The scientific and technical outcome of TWISNet is going to contribute to standards, such as IETF 6lowpan. These standards will be enhanced to make them capable of addressing the use cases proposed by the project.<!-- --> </p><p>International project<!-- -->, FP7-ICT-STREP<!-- -->, ID. 258280<!-- -->, October 2010 - October 2013</p><p> <!-- -->Members: Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Coordinator); Nicolae Tapus(Member); Laura RUSE(Member); Andrei Voinescu(Member); Silvia Cristina Stegaru(Member); Dan Tudose(Member); Alexandru Herisanu(Member); Razvan Tataroiu(Member); Dan Dragomir(Member)<!-- --> </p></div></div><div class="pubAndProj_projContainer___DFxI" loading="lazy"><div></div><div class="pubAndProj_pContent__H67lX"><p><a href="http://www.change-project.eu/" target="_blank">CHANGE - CHANGE</a></p><p> <!-- -->The goal of CHANGE is to reinvigorate innovation on the Internet, in order to better support current services and applications and enable those of tomorrow.

Making efficient use of massive computing infrastructures requires to radically rethinking the way we design the IT infrastructure. This means that a migration from the centralized computing approaches to fully-decentralized models is expected and this represents one of the current work objectives.  Considering the fact that each node is limited as computing capacity in comparison with the system&#x27;s size, the real power of computation is going to be the system as a whole, not the individual machines. In such an environment, centralized models based on master-worker or client-server paradigms are not compliant, as the huge number of requests coming from different peers will most probably overwhelm any central point considered. A distributed system, enhanced with self-organizing capabilities that facilitate global monitoring, fault tolerance and resource management is the target we want to reach. For this, we have studied classes of algorithms based on natural models, as they proved to be invariant to arbitrarily events in the group of communicating nodes. They are thus particularly well suited to continuously make a system converge to a desired state.<!-- --> </p><p>National project<!-- -->, PNII - Resurse Umane, PD<!-- -->, ID.

Obiectivul principal al cercetarii curente a constituit dezvoltarea unui model si a unui instrument asociat pentru evaluarea dinamica si optimizarea algoritmilor de planificare a activitatilor in Grid. Prin acest raport de cercetare, s-a propus o extindere a modelul si adaptarea pentru simularea sistemelor de tip Grid si a algoritmilor de planificare si gestiune a resurselor. Problema balansarii sarcinilor ocupa un rol esential in domeniul grid, atunci cand se doreste folosirea optima a resurselor disponibile. O distributie optima a sarcinilor pe procesoare conduce la timpi de executie redusi pentru job-uri si la o folosire eficienta a procesoarelor din sistem. Actualul proiect de cercetare este focalizat pe dezvoltarea unui scheduler descentralizat, bazat pe algoritmi genetici in scopul de a obtine o planificare optima. In contextul unui mediu dinamic, asa cum este cel al grid-ului, in care nodurile pot sa apara sau sa dispara in timp, un scheduler distribuit rezolva probleme de toleranta la defecte sau de adaptare dinamica la conditiile existente. Solutia de optimizare propusa va conduce la un model de planificator care va putea rula intr-o distributie grid cu cerinte minimale. In plus fata de acest aspect al specificarii platformei, un lucru important realizat prin acest proiect este rularea planificatorului in conditii real-time, monitorizand starea grid-ului si actualizand dinamic conditiile de executie a task-urilor alocate.

Obiectivul principal al cercetarii curente a constituit dezvoltarea unui model si a unui instrument asociat pentru evaluarea dinamica si optimizarea algoritmilor de planificare a activitatilor in Grid. Prin acest raport de cercetare, s-a propus o extindere a modelul si adaptarea pentru simularea sistemelor de tip Grid si a algoritmilor de planificare si gestiune a resurselor. Problema balansarii sarcinilor ocupa un rol esential in domeniul grid, atunci cand se doreste folosirea optima a resurselor disponibile. O distributie optima a sarcinilor pe procesoare conduce la timpi de executie redusi pentru job-uri si la o folosire eficienta a procesoarelor din sistem. Actualul proiect de cercetare este focalizat pe dezvoltarea unui scheduler descentralizat, bazat pe algoritmi genetici in scopul de a obtine o planificare optima. In contextul unui mediu dinamic, asa cum este cel al grid-ului, in care nodurile pot sa apara sau sa dispara in timp, un scheduler distribuit rezolva probleme de toleranta la defecte sau de adaptare dinamica la conditiile existente. Solutia de optimizare propusa va conduce la un model de planificator care va putea rula intr-o distributie grid cu cerinte minimale. In plus fata de acest aspect al specificarii platformei, un lucru important realizat prin acest proiect este rularea planificatorului in conditii real-time, monitorizand starea grid-ului si actualizand dinamic conditiile de executie a task-urilor alocate. In modelul de planificare, sunt folosite informatii de monitorizare obtinute in timp real, prin intermediul unor sisteme specializate. Algoritmul de planificare are la baza un principiile algoritmilor genetici."},{"year":"2007","hasLink":true,"url":"http://sinpha.ee.tuiasi.ro/","title":"SINPHA - SISTEME ÎNCORPORATE TIP NEUROPROTEZA PENTRU RECUPERAREA PERSOANELOR CU HANDICAP NEUROMOTOR","type":"National project","category":", Parteneriate","identificator":", ID.

Therefore, an increasing number of applications are developed in several business domains, ranging from defense, public security, energy management and traffic control to health care. Sensor networks are particularly interesting due to their ability to control and monitor physical environments. Nevertheless, several technical (e.g. remote management, deployment) and security (e.g. user’s privacy, data confidentiality and reliability) challenges deter that integration. The TWISNet project aims at supporting and securing the integration of sensor networks into large scale industrial environments. In the scope of TWISNet, a number of use cases, from nuclear plant facility to supply and demand energy management, which illustrate the integration of sensor networks into industrial environments are considered. From those use cases, user’s privacy, node authentication and data reliability appear as the most important security requirements. The TWISNet project is going to provide a platform enabling business application to command and control sensor network in a secure and trusted way. Integrating commercial off-the-shelf or pre-standard devices, that platform serves as a mediation layer between the sensor network and industrial applications. Empowered with security architecture addressing the major business application security requirements (e.g. user’s privacy, data confidentiality, reliability), that platform is validated based on the identified use cases. The scientific and technical outcome of TWISNet is going to contribute to standards, such as IETF 6lowpan. These standards will be enhanced to make them capable of addressing the use cases proposed by the project."},{"year":"2010","hasLink":true,"url":"http://www.change-project.eu/","title":"CHANGE - CHANGE","type":"International project","category":", FP7","identificator":", ID.

Making efficient use of massive computing infrastructures requires to radically rethinking the way we design the IT infrastructure. This means that a migration from the centralized computing approaches to fully-decentralized models is expected and this represents one of the current work objectives.  Considering the fact that each node is limited as computing capacity in comparison with the system's size, the real power of computation is going to be the system as a whole, not the individual machines. In such an environment, centralized models based on master-worker or client-server paradigms are not compliant, as the huge number of requests coming from different peers will most probably overwhelm any central point considered. A distributed system, enhanced with self-organizing capabilities that facilitate global monitoring, fault tolerance and resource management is the target we want to reach. For this, we have studied classes of algorithms based on natural models, as they proved to be invariant to arbitrarily events in the group of communicating nodes.

The versatile use of new mobile phones, and the development of home wireless networks, as well as the emergence of pervasive wireless systems, are strengthening this tendency.nTo date, no adverse health effects have been established, although questions still exist. In order to respond to the public concern, some national or local authorities have recommended some practices and measures to minimise EMF exposure, but these actions focus mainly on cellular network base stations and access points. Since the exposure is induced by the downlink (from the network to the phone), but also from the uplinks (from the phone to the network), these actions do not correctly respond to the relevant questions and even can induce a rise of exposure.n17 leading telecommunications operators, vendors, research centers and academic institutions have launched the LEXNET project (Low EMF Exposure Networks), a research project supported by the European Commission under the FP7 workprogram, to develop effective mechanisms to reduce 50% (at least) of the public exposure to EMF, without compromising the quality of service."},{"year":"2012","hasLink":true,"url":"http://sidedown.hpc.pub.ro","title":"SideDOWN - Smart Internet Data Downloader and Aggregator","type":"National project","category":", PNII - Servicii suport pentru inovare – Cecuri de ","identificator":", ID.

Water resources management requires the processing of a huge amount of information with different levels of accessibility and availability and in various formats. Often, the data acquisition needs to be acquired, transmitted and accessed in real time. Equally important is to have access to historical data for calibration and validation of the models. With regard to the accessibility of stakeholders to information, there are situations when information is to be accessed only by designated stakeholders, but there is a huge amount of information that is, and should be handled, as public information. The overarching goal of the proposal is to create an e-platform using advanced computational and communication technology for managing water and land resources in a sustainable and integrative manner, focused on pollution phenomena. The progress of information and communication technologies makes possible the access to relevant information and to provide feedback on the observed processes by means of e-services and ancillary data repositories. The multi-agent approach encompasses agent types with various behavior and specific interaction to the environment that are implemented as web-services. The specific objective is to implement a pilot platform for monitoring water pollution related phenomena and support to decision making in critical situation. Solving such water problems requires an interdisciplinary approach (hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and ecosystem). The composite application framework will integrate existing software and new e-services compliant to Directive 2007/2/EC regarding metadata for spatial data sets, data series and data services for environmental resources, protection and conservation."},{"year":"2012","hasLink":true,"url":"http://www.ihrg.pub.ro","title":"IHRG - AN INTELLIGENT HAPTIC ROBOT GLOVE for the PATIENTS SUFFERING A CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT","type":"National project","category":", Program Parteneriate","identificator":", ID. 150/2012","dates":", July 2012 - July 2016","members":"Members: Nirvana Popescu(Coordinator); Decebal Popescu(Member); Cornel Popescu(Member); Alin Moldoveanu(Member); Victor Asavei(Member)","description":"This project deals with the design and development of an Intelligent Haptic Robot-Glove (IHRG) for the rehabilitation of the patients that have been diagnosed with a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from a number of limitations when applied to multi-source scenarios requiring some form of query planning, and with frequent updates precluding any effective implementation of data indexes. Typical scenarios include open data, big data and virtual data integration systems. Therefore, building effective keyword searching techniques can have an extensive impact since it allows non-professional users to access large amounts of information stored in structured repositories through simple keyword-based query interfaces. This revolutionises the paradigm of searching for data since users are offered access to structured data in a similar manner to the one they already use for documents. To build a successful, unified and effective solution - due to the multifaceted nature of the problem - the Action proposes to join synergies from several disciplines, such as semantic data management, the semantic web, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, machine learning, user interaction, service science, service design, and natural language processing."},{"year":"2013","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"CS4HS - Google CS4HS R\u0026D Grant - Development and assessment of Python and Robotics Technical Skills","type":"International project","category":", R\u0026D Grant","identificator":"","dates":", April 2013 - February 2014","members":"Members: Razvan Rughinis(Coordinator); Daniel Rosner(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2013","hasLink":true,"url":"http://www.trilogy2.it.uc3m.es/","title":"TRILOGY2 - TRILOGY2","type":"International project","category":", FP7","identificator":"","dates":", January 2013 - January 2016","members":"Members: Costin Raiciu(Coordinator); Dragoș Ștefan Niculescu(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2013","hasLink":true,"url":"http://sidestep.hpc.pub.ro","title":"SideSTEP - Metode de Planificare pentru Sisteme Distribuite Dinamice: o Abordare Adaptiva (Scheduling Methods for Dynamic Distributed Systems: a self-* approach)","type":"International project","category":", PNII - Cooperări Bilaterale","identificator":", ID.

The objective of the Action is to improve and adapt the existent cryptanalysis methodologies and tools to the ubiquitous computing framework. Cryptanalysis, which is the assessment of theoretical and practical cryptographic mechanisms designed to ensure security and privacy, will be implemented along four axes: cryptographic models, cryptanalysis of building blocks, hardware and software security engineering, and security assessment of real-world systems. Researchers have only recently started to focus on the security of ubiquitous computing systems. Despite the critical flaws found, the required highly-specialized skills and the isolation of the involved disciplines are a true barrier for identifying additional issues. The Action will establish a network of complementary skills, so that expertise in cryptography, information security, privacy, and embedded systems can be put to work together.

Each time, unavailability of communication networks services, considered as an important part of critical infrastructure, in the presence of disasters implies evident societal problems for people desperately seeking for information, or trying to communicate with each other. The Action will fill this gap by offering the respective solutions to provide resilient communications in the presence of disaster-based disruptions of all types for existing communication networks (e.g., IPv4-based, current Internet), as well as emerging architectures of the global communications infrastructure (i.e., the Future Internet). Geographical diversity characteristics of disaster-based disruptions across Europe requires creation of an international and geographically diverse group of researchers to provide the proper solutions. Therefore, COST Action is viewed as the best way to address this issue. This output-oriented Action will be driven by researchers from academia and industry in strong cooperation with governmental bodies. The aim is to introduce the set of techniques of resilient communications, as well as recommendations on how to deploy/update topologies of communication networks to make them resistant to disruptions that can be applied in practice by network equipment operators and national/international network providers at the European level."},{"year":"2015","hasLink":true,"url":"https://5g-ppp.eu/superfluidity/","title":"SUPERFLUIDITY - Superfluidity: a super-fluid, cloud-native, converged edge system","type":"International project","category":", Horizon 2020","identificator":", ID.

The development of powerful analytical tools, significant insights in general limitations of different types of nature-inspired optimisation methods and the development of more practically relevant perspectives for theoretical analysis have brought impressive advances to the theory-side of the field.

When this high blood pressure is combined with a high protein level in urine, the mother is affected by preeclampsia. This asymptomatic pathology usually starts in the second semester and affects 10% of pregnant women. To diagnose preeclampsia, doctors usually monitor the BP by two measurements of blood pressure during the second and the third semester. However, the BP measurements are not always likely to happen while the mother is experiencing a hypertensive episode. Thus, the pathology cannot be detected on time, and the mother is exposed to a higher risk of eclampsia. Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizure in pregnant women following by a period of confusion and/or coma. Eclampsia is a vital emergency for both the fetuses and the mother. It represents the second causes of maternal death during pregnancy.nHere, the gap in diagnostics is caused by the discontinuity of the blood pressure measurement, which brings the necessity to develop new technologies to ensure continuous monitoring of blood pressure."},{"year":"2016","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"CONDEGRID - Contributia nationala la dezvoltarea gridului de calcul LCG pentru fizica particulelor elementare","type":"National project","category":"","identificator":"","dates":", March 2016 - December 2019","members":"Members: Nicolae Tapus(Coordinator); Mihai Carabas(Member); Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2016","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"Premiere H2020 - Data4Water","type":"National project","category":", UEFISCDI","identificator":"","dates":", 2016 - 2018","members":"Members: Mariana Mocanu(Coordinator); Alexandru Predescu(Member); Catalin Negru(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2016","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"Text2NeuralQL - Interogarea bazelor de date în limbaj natural folosind învățare profundă","type":"National project","category":"","identificator":", ID.

The complexity of research related to water resources management is extremely high and requires deep expertise in several ICT-related research domains such as: Big Data and Smart Data; semantic Internet of Things; context-aware and event-based systems; Cloud computing; Web services;, and social Web. The dynamics of water and the role of humans in the water cycle are not well understood largely because environmental and socio-economic analyses have traditionally been performed separately; and the methods, tools, and data needed for multidisciplinary work are not yet at the required level to satisfactory address problems posed in managing resources in aquatic environments. ICT can contribute to several areas of research such as better understanding of coupled human-natural system dynamics; finding risk mitigation measures for the unintended consequences and side effects like water scarcity, increased pollution, unreasonable use of water, flood, food prices; and can contribute to the development of strategies for efficient use of water resources."}],"2017":[{"year":"2017","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"SOVAREX - TEHNICI DE STOCARE ȘI VALORIFICARE A REZULTATELOR CERCETĂRILOR ȘTIINȚIFICE AVANSATE","type":"National project","category":"","identificator":"","dates":", November 2017 - December 2018","members":"Members: Nicolae Tapus(Coordinator); Mihai Carabas(Member); Ciprian Dobre(Member); Florin Pop(Member); Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Member); George Pantelimon Popescu(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2017","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"SIMULATE - Simulări a interacţiei pulsului laser ultraintens cu ținte solide","type":"National project","category":"","identificator":"","dates":", October 2017 - December 2019","members":"Members: Mihai Carabas(Coordinator); Nicolae Tapus(Member); Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Member); George Pantelimon Popescu(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2017","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"VDAQ-CEX - Versatile approach to integrated large data aquisition system for complex ELI-NP experiments","type":"National project","category":"","identificator":"","dates":", October 2017 - December 2019","members":"Members: Nicolae Tapus(Coordinator); Mihai Carabas(Member); Emil-Ioan Slusanschi(Member); George Pantelimon Popescu(Member)","description":""},{"year":"2017","hasLink":false,"url":"","title":"SAFE-VR - Sistem pentru Ameliorarea Fobiilor prin Expunere la Realitatea Virtuală","type":"National project","category":"","identificator":", ID.
